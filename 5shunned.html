  <h1>Shunned</h1>
  <p>
    María Sabina was shunned by her community for commercializing 
    their traditions and claimed the niños santos lost their power after 
    so much misuse. She died in poverty in 1985, at 91 years old.

      <h2>Aftermath</h2>
      <p>
        The story of Maria Sabina and R. Gordon Wasson in Life kicked off a wave of psychedelic tourism that would forever disrupt 
        Huaulta de Jimenez. Formerly off the beaten path, the town was finding itself a destination for beatniks and hippies, to the 
        chagrin of locals who resented the change. Nude, tripping gringos became a frequent sight in the streets. Mexican police federal
         authorities believed her to be a drug dealer, bringing 
         yet more unwanted attention to the community. The 
         blame was laid squarely at Maria Sabina’s door by her neighbours, as she continued to accept these tourists for the velada, despite 
         her own misgivings, saying “I realized the young people with long hair didn’t need me to eat the little things. Kids ate them anywhere 
         and anytime, and they didn’t respect our customs.”
    
         The floods of visitors clamouring to see her angered her community as they threatened their Maztec customs — 
         this culminated with the burning down of her house as punishment. Eventually, in 1967, the Mexican army set up guard 
         around the roads to the village, and life returned somewhat to normal.
