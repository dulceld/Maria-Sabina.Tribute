    <h1>Shunned</h1>
    <p>
      María Sabina was shunned by her community for commercializing 
      their traditions and claimed the niños santos lost their power after 
      so much misuse. She died in poverty in 1985, at 91 years old.

    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
  <p>
    The story of Maria Sabina and R. Gordon Wasson in Life kicked off a wave of psychedelic tourism that would forever disrupt 
    Huaulta de Jimenez. Formerly off the beaten path, the town was finding itself a destination for beatniks and hippies, to the 
    chagrin of locals who resented the change. Nude, tripping gringos became a frequent sight in the streets. Mexican police federal
     authorities arrived, concerned even before the official criminalization of psilocybin about the sale of drugs to foreigners. The 
     blame was laid squarely at Maria Sabina’s door by her neighbours, as she continued to accept these tourists for the velada, despite 
     her own misgivings, saying “I realized the young people with long hair didn’t need me to eat the little things. Kids ate them anywhere 
     and anytime, and they didn’t respect our customs.”
