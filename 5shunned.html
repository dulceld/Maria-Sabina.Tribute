    <h1>Shunned</h1>
    <p>
      María Sabina was shunned by her community for commercializing 
      their traditions and claimed the niños santos lost their power after 
      so much misuse. She died in poverty in 1985, at 91 years old, but not 
      before tending to the likes of Bob Dylan and John Lennon.
