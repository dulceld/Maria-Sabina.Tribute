    <h1>The Defilement of the Mushroom Ritual</h1>
<h2>
MK Ultra Experiments

</h2>
      <p>
        Tim Leary, became the great guru of LSD, his interest in psychedelic drugs was sparked by an article that appeared in Life magazine in 1957 (by Andrew Hoffman).
      The CIA experimented with mushrooms as part of their infamous mind-control program, MK Ultra. MK-Ultra, or Operation Midnight Climax, 
      saw US government officials secretly test the effects of LSD on hundreds of oblivious American citizens and military personnel 
      in New York and San Francisco.
      Later on in life, Tim Leary said the entire LSD movement was started by the CIA. 
      The CIA  set up phony philanthropic foundations which then funded university and college research, and it's through those research 
      experiments that americans got introduced to LSD. The university researchers had no idea 
      that their research was actually being funded by the CIA.
      So all of these original strands that came together in the '60s to produce this great countercultural revolt based around 
      LSD can be traced back through these bogus foundations to the CIA and, ultimately, the director of MK-Ultra, Sidney Gottlieb.

        Inhuman Experiment Trials in the U.S
      </h3>
      <p>
        Whitey Bulger was one of the prisoners who volunteered for what he was told was an experiment aimed at finding a cure for 
        schizophrenia. As part of this experiment, he was given LSD every day for more than a year. He later realized that this had 
        nothing to do with schizophrenia, and he was a guinea pig in a government experiment aimed at seeing what people's long-term 
        reactions to LSD was; essentially, could we make a person lose his mind by feeding him LSD every day over such a long period?
        Bulger wrote afterword about his experiences, which he described as quite horrific. He thought he was going insane. He wrote, 
        I was in prison for committing a crime, but they committed a greater crime on me. 
        On October 24, 1968, possession of LSD was made illegal in the United States. The last FDA approved study of LSD in 
        patients ended in 1980, while a study in healthy volunteers was made in the late 1980s.
