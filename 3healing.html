    <h1>Healing Methods</h1>
    <p><div class="boxed">
      Among the Mazatec people, the most common healing method since prior 
      to the colonial period, was the ritual intake of fungi of a species 
      called Mexican Psilocybe and which grow only in a particular mountain 
      range. When visited by someone with some physical or spiritual condition, 
      Sabina served as a guide on the patient’s journey to, and return from, 
      spiritual realms (along with a cure for the illness). To Sabina, mushrooms
       were an instrument for connecting dimensions and realities that happen in 
       parallel. Because of their peculiarity, intensity, and various reports of 
       effectiveness, Sabina’s healing sessions became very popular in the Mexico 
       of the early 1950s.
