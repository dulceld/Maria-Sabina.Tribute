    <h1>Psychedelic Superstar</h1>
    
    <p>
      María Sabina became something like a global psychedelic superstar 
      and inadvertently sparked a cultural revolution that reverberates 
      to this day. 
      The story of Maria Sabina, her fame, and her mystery, caught the attention of media and personalities from many parts of 
      the world and from other disciplines. One of the first was an American, Robert Gordon Wasson, an economist by profession.

      The “discovery” of what Wasson was the first to dub “magic mushrooms” was coupled with a strange sort of 
      innocence and a sense of novelty. It was, after all, on the cover of Life Magazine, one of America’s most popular and family-friendly
       magazines, that this story broke in June of 1957. 
       Wasson eventually let slip the truth. Vision seekers, hippies, and apocryphally a few rock stars found their way to Huautla de 
       Jimenez, all looking for a dose of mushrooms. Sabina, whether through a generosity of spirit or a sense of duty, did not always 
       charge for her services in administering the mushrooms.
