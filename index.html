    <p>
      Born into the Mazatec ethnic group in 1894, she came from a small town called Huautla de Jiménez, in the Sierra de Oaxaca, 
      located in southern Mexico. Her father’s family had already included several shamans. From a very young age, contact with 
      them brought her closer to the region’s traditional ceremonies, which included the intake of hallucinogenic mushrooms (known as
       “holy children”) as a method of contact with divinity. She first tried the mushrooms at the age of eight. It’s said that she intuitively developed a knowledge of the rituals and their healing power which, in her culture, was attributed to these mushrooms.
